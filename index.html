        <h2>A weather station using a raspberry pi Pico W, a DHT11 temperature sensor, photoresistor and some way of measuring wind speed. 
            I would have to think about waterproofing this for the British weather and as it's a Pico w I can connect this to my home network and have it ping this website.</h2>

        <h2>Enough about my nerdy hobbies! I am Jacob from, you guess the UK!
             I love electrical engineering; your whole life is influenced by electrical engineering! 
             What are you reading this on? I love physics in general, the (As of writing) recent successful nuclear fusion experiment produced enough energy to charge 17 smartphones for 1 hour in nanoseconds, even less! 
             (15watt wall adapter). Other hobbies are coding, look I made this, and artificial intelligence, tennis is very cool, and I like going to the gym (I'm a bit of a gym bro).</h2>
